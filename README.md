# class-options
## ES6/ES2015 class options

- Provides declarative validation of class parameters at instantiation
- Descriptors define how to validate parameters, supporting primitives, constructor validation, and custom validation
- Subclass parameters can be merged with and validated against superclass defaults and descriptors
- Currently exploring a more functional approach to alleviate defining object literal descriptors and to simplify validation/use
- See the [develop](https://github.com/0x59/class-options/tree/develop) branch for the latest code
